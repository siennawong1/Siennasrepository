                    <p>I tried to design a website that emulated my box design from the previous activity.
                        I also liked the idea of having simple shapes as a running theme over each page.</p>

                    <p>When you first open TEMU you are taken to their homepage which features a search bar at the top alongside a navigation bar.  The categories section features a drop-down list of different products 
                        categorised into things like clothing and home & kitchen.  When clicking on one of these 
                        categories, you are then taken to multiple circular images of different subcategories, and as you hover your mouse over the images, a drop shadow appears behind them.  
                        When you click on a subcategory you are then taken to a page full of products, again as you hover your mouse over each image a drop shadow appears behind it. In addition, a translucent rectangular 
                        label appears over the image that contains more detail of the product.  When you click on a product image, you are then taken to a completely new page which opens in a separate tab.  Here, you are given more details 
                        about the product. When you hover your curser over different information, like sizes, additional information pops up in a speech bubble.

        <h3>Website Inspiration</h3>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/exhibition/yayoi-kusama/?765">NGV YayYoi Kusama Website</a>
        
        <p>My main source of inspiration was the Yayoi NGV Website.  I took inspiration from the Nav bar, footer and the downwards scrolling and I liked 
            the smooth style change between each section. I also liked the central layout of the main body and large title page.</p>
<br>
            <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMa Website</a>
            <p>I took inspiration from the layout of the moving main image, with the text positioned underneath it,
                leading the viewer downwards. I also liked the white and black style, with consistent simple typeface.</p>

<!-- Workshop 1 -->

    <div class="workshop-text">
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>I started by playing around with shapes, colours, grids, containers and buttons. I learnt how to link images and shapes to different pages. 
            I found it took a few tries to get the correct dimensions for the grid and shapes to all fit
            in the box neatly.

        <h3>Day 2 and 3</h3>
        <p>I then tried to create a homepage in a similar 'gaming/box' style. To get to each week you can click on the shape above it. 
            I added a back button in the top left corner inspired by the back button of the CDG website.

        <h3>Day 4</h3>
        <p>I then created a page for each week, consisting of a nav bar, weeks bar, header and area 
            for content. 
            I started playing more with colour changes and the hover effect. I found it very 
            challenging to create a page with good spacing, as my overall layout 
            lacked coherence and looked very 'ugly'. I found it especially challenging 
            when making a flexbox for my main content and how to display the images and text 
            next to each other so it was easy to read.  I spent hours making many variations of this layout.

        <h3>Day 5</h3>
        <p>After achieveing basic understanding of html and css I now 
            decided to work harder on the layout and style of my webpage and add more interactive details. 
            I changed my whole colour scheme so colours were more muted and less harsh on the eye. I completely 
            changed my homepage so that it was more consistent with the weeks pages.

        <h3>Day 6 </h3>
        <p>I now started refining details including changing custom cursors when hovering over certain buttons, adding a moving gradient heading for homepage, 
            and making the main body layout easier to read by adjusting the flexbox.  To get elements in a better position, I just kept 
            adjusting margins and padding on everything.

        <h3>Day 7 </h3>
        <p>One of my favourite features included the radial circle button with colour change, which was fun to code and play around with.
        
            <br> <br> I also experimented with the homepage a lot, especially the 
            green and orange circles and how they interacted with each other. I liked having them
            change depending on what size the screen was.

        <h3>Day 8</h3>
        <p>Upon reflection, I decided to change the font for the headings, 
            and added more gifs to make the homepage more interactive. I also removed the gradient
            hover background as this clashed with the gifs imagery. 
            <br> I decided to have more of an old school computer theme, instead of the box idea
            which I found hard to bring to life. So my idea more evolves around a 'pixel'/'old windows'/'game'
            aesthetic.  The landing page felt more like logging into a computer, but also 
            reminded me of when you asked to verify that you are not a robot.
